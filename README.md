# COSC344
The aim of COSC344 is to teach the principles of designing a database, use of a database management system, and the design and implementation of the underlying database management system software.
<br>
Issues of data modelling and database design are explored briefly. The relational model, relational algebra and operators are covered as well as functional dependencies and normalisation. The query language, SQL, and programming within the database using PL/SQL and triggers are explored. The course introduces interfacing SQL externally to Java, C, and PHP. Database recovery and protection, issues of transactions, concurrent access and query optimisation are covered. The underlying storage structures and access methods are explained. New techniques such as NoSQL data modelling will be introduced.
